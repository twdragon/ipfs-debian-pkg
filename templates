Template: ipfs-kubo/network-profile-note
Type: note
Description: IPFS networking profile
 CAUTION!!! Thorough selection of the proper networking profile for your IPFS
 daemon is IMPORTANT!!! Please read this text carefully!
 .
 - server - the profile dedicated to the systems that have publicly available
 external IP address, assuming the loal peer discovery should be closed.
 .
 - test - this profile reduces the external interactions made my IPFS node as
 much as it is possible, feasible for testing environments.
 .
 - lowpower - the special profile dedicated to the machines that have very low
 amount of resources. It reduces the IPFS impact on the system as much as it 
 is possible. Consider also usage of the system service limits to reduce that
 impact.
 .
 - default-networking [default] - local daemon profile, feasible for the most
 desktop systems, including local peer discovery, pretty similar to BitTorrent.
