Description: Kubo was the first IPFS implementation and is the most widely used
 one today. Implementing the Interplanetary Filesystem - the Web3 standard for
 content-addressing, interoperable with HTTP. Thus powered by IPLD's data
 models and the libp2p for network communication. Kubo is written in Go.
